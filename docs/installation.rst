Installing faampy
=================

Installation of faampy is done in the usual way using the setup script::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

So far the modul has only been tested on linux machines.


Data, dbs, ...
==============

Example data and databases of flight tracks are available for download. After installing the faampy module you can run::

   faampy data_download ZIP_PASSWORD

from the command line. This will download a zip file and copies its content to a 'faampy_files' directory in your $HOME. However, for the moment the zip file that you download is password protected. Please contact me if you think you need the data.


Disclaimer
============

faampy is in its early stages and has not been thoroughly tested. There will more modules been added in the near future. A backlog of moduls exists that have been written, but will need to be tidied up, before being added to the repository. Watch this space.
